# Capability attestation

Autonomous powers are unlocked only when their guarantees can be freshly and positively proved. A
driver does not declare that it supports a capability; it is probed, and the result is recorded as
a `CapabilityAttestation` event in the run log. The Control plane gates on recorded attestations,
never on driver self-report.

  G -->|absent / stale / negative / out-of-scope| Deny["Fail closed — capability off"]
```

## Ownership

`CapabilityAttestation` is an SDK-owned type. Providers emit attestation payloads; the SDK
appends them to the run log and evaluates them when a gate is consulted. The testkit validates
that provider implementations emit correctly shaped attestations, but it does not own the type.
Recorded or mock attestations use the same SDK payload shape and gate path for core tests and
provider conformance fixtures. They do not make a real driver production-ready; live provider
powers require fresh positive probe evidence from the concrete provider and platform scope that will
be used.

## Attestation shape

Every `CapabilityAttestation` record carries:

| Field | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `capability` | Named provider guarantee being attested (e.g. `canKill`, `canRelayApproval`, `supportsMergeQueue`). Core autonomous powers such as `auto-merge` are *evaluated* from attestations by a gate; they are not themselves provider attestations. |
| `probeMethod` | How the probe was performed (distinguishes active test from passive observation) |
| `result` | `positive` or `negative` |
| `evidenceRef` | Reference to the raw probe evidence appended to the run log |
| `scope` | The run, driver instance, or platform context the attestation covers |
| `expiry` | When the attestation becomes stale and must be re-probed |
| `driverVersion` | Version of the driver that produced the attestation |
| `platform` | Platform/environment context |
| `freshnessKey` | Re-probe trigger: if this key changes, the attestation is stale |
| `at` | Timestamp the probe completed |
| `details` (optional) | Provider-specific proof metadata (e.g. containment strength, egress policy digest) |

## Payload vs. reference

The fields above are the attestation **payload**. When the SDK appends an attestation to the run log,
the resulting log event carries an envelope `eventId` — `eventId` is **not** a payload field. A
capability gate cites the attestation it relied on by reference: an `AttestationRef { eventId, … }`
pointing at the appended event (see
[gate evaluation & records](../30-domain-reference/core/capability-and-safety/gate-evaluation-and-records.md)).
So `eventId` lives at the envelope / reference level, never inside the `CapabilityAttestation` itself.

## Evaluation rules

A gate treats an attestation as absent — and the corresponding capability as off — when any of
the following are true:

- No attestation for the capability is present in the run log.
- The attestation is stale (past `expiry`, or `freshnessKey` has changed).
- `result` is `negative`.
- The attestation is out of scope for the current action.
- Attestations are contradictory or non-replayable.
- The run log is degraded and replay is not usable.

Self-report from a worker or driver (prose, a claim in a tool call, an unprobed flag) is never
sufficient and is always rejected as the sole support for a gate allow.

A recorded or mock attestation may satisfy mock-driven core/conformance tests when its source is a
testkit provider or recorded fixture and its scope matches the test. Production live powers require
fresh positive live/provider probe evidence; recorded or mock evidence never upgrades a real driver
to production-ready.

## Capability examples by provider

- **Agent (`prov-01`):** `canRelayApproval`, `canResumeOwned`, `emitsStructuredToolExit`
- **Execution Host (`prov-04`):** `canKill`, `containmentStrength`, egress confinement (proven by
  a negative probe that a disallowed host is actually blocked)
- **Forge (`prov-02`):** `supportsRulesets`, `supportsMergeQueue`, `supportsThreadResolution`,
  `canInspectProtection`
- **Work Source (`prov-03`):** `supportsClaim`, `supportsStatusWrite`, `supportsTracks`,
  `supportsDependencies`
