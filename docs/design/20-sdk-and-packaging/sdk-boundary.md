# SDK boundary

The SDK is the reusable product library. It owns deterministic orchestration and the abstract provider
contracts. Its dependency surface must remain narrow: pure runtime libraries only (e.g. zod and small
pure utilities). Any dependency that pulls a platform-specific native module, a CLI parser, a network
client, or a process-execution helper is forbidden from the SDK.

## What the SDK owns

The SDK owns:

- The core runtime API exposed to callers (`createWorkflowKit` factory and its return type)
- Run and event types; the event log append/replay model
- The four provider interfaces: `AgentProvider`, `ExecutionHostProvider`, `ForgeProvider`,
  `WorkSourceProvider` (canonical type catalog:
  [provider-ports.md](provider-ports.md))
- `CapabilityAttestation` type and the capability gate evaluation logic (core-02). The canonical
  payload shape is in [provider-ports.md](provider-ports.md).
- Evidence refs, config/policy DTOs, approval and gate models
- Recovery classification and the replay/projection engine (core-06)
- Storage **port interfaces**: `EventLogStorePort`, `ArtifactStorePort`, `LeaseStorePort`
  (canonical type catalog: [storage-port-types.md](storage-port-types.md))
- **In-memory default implementations** of those storage ports (suitable for tests and simple
  single-process use)

The storage port interfaces and their in-memory defaults belong in the SDK because the Control plane
depends on them directly. See the deep spec at
[docs/design/30-domain-reference/foundation/storage-and-artifacts/README.md](../30-domain-reference/foundation/storage-and-artifacts/README.md)
for the full contract (append durability classes, lease fencing, artifact write-once guarantees, and
network-filesystem degradation behavior). The `*StorePort` names are SDK injection names for the same
contract surface typed as `EventLogStore`, `ArtifactStore`, and `LeaseStore` in
[storage-port-types.md](storage-port-types.md).

### Where concrete stores live

The SDK's in-memory implementations are not suitable for production use across process restarts.
Production executables need a filesystem-backed store. That concrete store is **wired in by the
executables** (cli and mcp), not by the SDK itself. This keeps the SDK dependency-light.

A native-backed store — for example, a SQLite implementation that pulls a native binary dependency —
must live in its **own adapter package** outside the SDK (e.g. `store-sqlite` or similar). The SDK
depends only on the port interface, not on any concrete backend.

```
sdk           — owns port interfaces + in-memory defaults
cli / mcp     — wire in the filesystem-backed concrete store at startup
store-sqlite  — (if needed) separate adapter package; never imported by sdk
```

## What the SDK must not own

The SDK must never import:

- Concrete provider packages (`provider-codex`, `provider-local`, `provider-github`, `provider-markdown`)
- `cli` or `mcp`
- `testkit` mocks
- `@octokit/*` or any GitHub client
- `execa` or any process-execution helper
- A native containment helper
- A concrete Codex protocol client
- The MCP server runtime
- A CLI parser

These restrictions are enforced statically. See [dependency-rules.md](dependency-rules.md).

## Factory shape

The `createWorkflowKit` factory is how callers supply concrete providers and storage ports to the SDK.
The SDK receives them at construction time and never discovers or imports them directly.

```ts
export function createWorkflowKit(input: {
  providers: {
    agent: AgentProvider;
    executionHost: ExecutionHostProvider;
    forge: ForgeProvider;
    workSource: WorkSourceProvider;
  };
  ports: {
    clock: Clock;
    ids: IdGenerator;
    eventLog: EventLogStorePort;
    artifacts: ArtifactStorePort;
    leases: LeaseStorePort;
  };
  policy: ResolvedPolicy;
}): WorkflowKit;
```

All time, identity, randomness, storage, and provider behavior is injected. The SDK contains no
ambient `Date.now`, `Math.random`, or `crypto.randomUUID` in deterministic logic.
